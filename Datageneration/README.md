# Dataset generation
We concluded that the dataset which we recieved was very difficult to work with as
the intention when we began the thesis was to recieve text data and not audio data.

This led us to manually transcribing some of the data from the audio files and then to
use this module to generate alike dialogue sets and on our own be able to generate
a good amount of training and validation data. The manually transcribed text will be used as test
data.
